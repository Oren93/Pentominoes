### About

This project was created as a final assignment for the course *graphical user interface* , first year - spring semester, university of Iceland.
It is good for solving pentominoes pazzles, see here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino
The original task was to create a graphical solution for 5 given boards (templates), I added a board editor feature that allows the user to create new boards.
### How it works
When opening the programm there are 5 sample boards, shown initially empty, so you can try and solve it, then by pressing &larr; and  &rarr; you see all the possible solutions for that board.
You can add your own board by using the board editor, under "file -> board editor", more specific instructions can be found under "Help -> Get started"

### How to run it
You will need add mig layout jar file to the enviroment and comile and run the file *PentoComponent.java* . You can also add the zip file to netbeans and run from there.
